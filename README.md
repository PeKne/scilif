# README
Demo aplication demostrating commucation of smartphone (*client*) with BLE devices (*servers*).

Based on [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), with use of [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) framework.

Since Expo is not supporting Bluetooth comunication yet, [expo developent client](https://docs.expo.dev/clients/introduction/) in combination with [react-native-ble-plx](https://dotintent.github.io/react-native-ble-plx/) library are used. The expo dev client is new functionality allowing to build expo application with third party packages (*react-native-ble-plx* in our case) without need of MacOS device.

Project is configured and tested runing on physical Iphone SE device.
